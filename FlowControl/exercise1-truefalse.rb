# Write wether the following expressions evaluate 
# to true or false

puts (32*4) >= 129  # >>>>>false


puts false != !true # >>>>>>>false

puts true == 4  # >>>>> False , because
#TRUE does NOT equate to 4 or vice versa. 

puts false == (847=='847') # >>>> TRUE , since 847 is an integer that does not 
# equate to a string. So that expression is false.
# But false equates to false. So that comparison is true, hence
# The whole expression is true.

 (!true || (!(100/5 == 20) || ((328/4) == 82)) || false

#  This should evaluate to true
